# AWS Learning Journey ☁️

**Beginner-friendly AWS notes and hands-on labs, built as I learn.**

This repository is my personal log of learning AWS from scratch. I'm combining theory with real-world practice—covering core AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, and more.

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- To understand AWS deeply through hands-on work
- To document my progress and build a personal cloud reference
- To help other beginners by sharing what I learn

## 🧭 Topics I'm Covering

- ✅ EC2: Linux/Windows setup, web hosting, SSH/RDP access
- ✅ S3: Static website hosting, versioning, permissions
- ✅ IAM: Users, roles, policies, MFA
- 🔜 VPC: Subnets, routing, internet gateway
- 🔜 Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch, and more...

## 🗂️ Structure

Each folder contains:
- `notes.md` → Concepts and core theory
- `setup.md` → Step-by-step hands-on guides
- Scripts / templates (PowerShell, shell, YAML, etc.)

## 📅 Started on: 1 July 2025
